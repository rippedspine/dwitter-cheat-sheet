# dwitter-cheat-sheet
Tips and tricks I picked up from awesome dweets at [Dwitter](https://dwitter.net).

You can find my [dweets here](https://www.dwitter.net/u/rippedspine) :)


## even/odd using `&` ([bitwise AND](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators#Bitwise_AND))
instead of i%2==0 to get even/odd, do x&1

- `1&1 -> 1`
- `2&1 -> 0`
- `3.2&1 -> 1`


## to the power of

- `2**3` == `Math.pow(2,3)`


## less bits to write 1000, 20000, 300000 etc...

- `1e3 -> 1000`
- `2e4 -> 20000`
- `3e5 -> 300000`
- ...


## setting (only) fontsize
x.font needs to have a font family set, or else it will ignore font size

- `x.font="6em ðŸ¤·"` 'ðŸ¤·' can be any character

## shortest way to clear canvas using `|` ([bitwise OR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators#Bitwise_OR))
not sure how this works...

- `c.width|=0`
- edit: `c.width^=0` seem to have the same effect, interesting. [bitwise XOR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators#Bitwise_XOR).

## for loops
from [basic dwitter guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/dwitter/comments/7mgcd1/basic_dwitter_guide/) by [Xen](https://www.dwitter.net/u/Xen/top)

- `for(i=9;i--;second_thing)thing;`


## initiate values
If you need to initiate a value at the beginning of the loop, like for a counter.

- `t||(count=0);count++`
- `t?run:setup` (`t?count++:count=0`)

### credit is where credit's due
The above tips and tricks are snatched from a number of dweets. Sometimes I forgot which, or I have seen the same trick used in multiple dweets by different users. As much as possible I will try to keep track on and list dweets where I got some or multiple trick from here:

-  [#5132](https://www.dwitter.net/d/5132) by [Erazed](https://www.dwitter.net/u/Erazed) `c.width^=0` and `x.font="6em ðŸ¤·"`
- `t?run:setup` [Xen](https://www.dwitter.net/u/Xen/top)
